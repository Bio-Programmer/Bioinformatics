# This repository contains programs that assist in common processes used when analyzing biological data.

# Some of the programs were created as a solution to a Rosalind Bioinformatics problem 
# Here is the link to Rosalind: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/

# Others were created simply as tools for my personal bioinformatics projects.
